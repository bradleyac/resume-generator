TODOS LOS TODOS

!!!
1. Set up continuous deployment for the container to build and publish the docker image. Can copy from Dominion for this.
2. Implement importing and browsing job descriptions + artifacts
3. Look into how to have an OpenAI call generate weights based on JD text
4. Implement custom resume display based on weights vector?
5. Integrate OpenAI call in the trigger to generate weights and pass those to the resume before saving as PDF
6. Implement searching for imported descriptions

1. The page doesn't always load fully before the PDF is saved. This causes some of the icons to not display (16kb difference in the file size).
2. Set up proper configuration instead of hard-coding URLs.
3. Fix janky project structure.
